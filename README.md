# Random Python hackerrank problems in one line
- No semi-colons, No gimmicks, just lambdas and state manipulation. 
- So before you go shouting over the roof, some programs aren't one-liners cause hackerrank doesn't allow me to remove the boiler-plate code for getting the input. but yeah it's just an extra lambda to get and throw the input into the function to make it one line.

### why am I wasting my time like this?
- why not? , just for the funzies
- I don't understand what I write, but hey it's rewarding when it all comes together in a single line.

### Bonus
- All programs in python can be converted to a single line if u eval the decoded base64 version of the source-code
- All the above programms are originally written by me, when I was bored.
- As a timestamp , I started this challenge on 9th Jun 2021.
